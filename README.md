Fast cards reposition
=====================

This add on allows to reposition new cards (changing the due field) in a fast way from the browser view (without using the reposition tool).

To use this add on, sort the cards in the browser by due date. At this point three new buttons appear on the toolbar and can be used to move cards up, down and to top.

Multiple cards can be moved together.

Using the shortcuts ALT+Up/Down/0 repositioning is even faster.
